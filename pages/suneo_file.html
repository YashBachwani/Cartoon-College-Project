<b><u><h1 style="opacity:0.9; color:black; text-align:center;">SUNEO</h1></u></b>
<b><h3 align="center">Suneo is a rich and cunning boy who likes to show off and flatter Jiyan.</h3></b>
<b><blockquote><p>Suneo Honekawa is the fox-faced (inherited from his mother) rich child who loves to flaunt his material wealth before everyone, especially Nobita.
<br><br>He is a spoiled rich kid who likes to show off his cool stuff to his friends and make them jealous. The friends he hangs out with mostly are Nobita, Doraemon, Gian and Shizuka. He sometimes brags to his friends to things like meeting up with famous stars. 
<br><br>
He gets highest in monthly pocket money and buys cool toys and comic books, but he never lets Nobita touch his comics and cool toys, which provokes his anger and jealousy. He usually hangs out with Gian to think he is the coolest kid in the world like Gian and often bullies, irritates and/or beats up Nobita with Gian. </p></blockquote></b>
