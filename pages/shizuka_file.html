<b><u><h1 style="opacity:0.9; color:black; text-align:center;">SHIZUKA</h1></u></b>
<b><h3 align="center">Shizuka is Nobita's love interest and a smart, kind, and friendly girl.</h3></b>
<b><blockquote><p>Shizuka is a young girl with fair skin, black hair (brown in the 1973 and 1979 anime) with pigtails. She often wears a long-sleeved dress, and has two socks cover her feet, orange shoes. The 1973 and 1979 versions of the dress are pink with a white stripe close to the skirt's hem.
<br><br>Shizuka Minamoto  also known by her nickname Sue in the American and UK versions, is the tritagonist of the Doraemon franchise, being the only main female character.
<br><br>In the future after marrying Nobita, she is also known as Shizuka Nobi or Mrs. Nobi.Shizuka is a smart and kind neighbourhood girl. She is, unlike Nobita, a quick-witted and very studious child. Shizuka loves to bathe and does it several times a day passionately. Unlike Nobita, Suneo, and Gian, she is not a fan of video games for the most part. </p></blockquote></b>
